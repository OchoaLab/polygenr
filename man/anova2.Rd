\title{Get ANOVA type-II p-values from genetic model}
\usage{
anova2(X, y, pcs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The genotype matrix.
Each row of \code{X} receives a p-value.
Unlike other functions, where \code{X} is expected to be genome-wide, here we don't use penalized models so \code{X} must have fewer predictors (loci) than samples (individuals).
These predictiors are expected to have been selected in a previous step by \code{glmnet} or another such approach.}

\item{y}{The trait vector.
It must have length equal to the number of individuals.}

\item{pcs}{The PC (eigenvector) matrix (optional).
It must have individuals along the rows and dimensions along the columns.
Unlike \code{X}, all of \code{pcs} receives a single p-value (even if it contains multiple columns; for computational efficiency, it is assumed that selection or ranking of individual PCs is not of interest).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing these columns: 'Df', 'SS', 'RSS', 'AIC', 'F', 'p'.
The first row is for the full model, followed by statistics for \code{pcs} if present, followed by per-locus statistics for \code{X}.
If \code{X} had rownames, these are the names of the variables, otherwise 'x1', 'x2', and so on are used.
}
\description{
This function assings p-values to a polyygenic linear model.
Essentially a wrapper around \code{\link[stats:add1]{stats::drop1()}} to assign p-values to a small number of selected loci while fitting PCs without caring about their significance.
